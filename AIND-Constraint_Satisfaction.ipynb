    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problems Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Constraint Satisfaction is a technique for solving problems by expressing limits on the values of each variable in the solution with mathematical constraints.  We've used constraints before -- constraints in the Sudoku project are enforced implicitly by filtering the legal values for each box, and the planning project represents constraints as arcs connecting nodes in the planning graph -- but in this lab exercise we will use a symbolic math library to explicitly construct binary constraints and then use Backtracking to solve the N-queens problem (which is a generalization [8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)).  Using symbolic constraints should make it easier to visualize and reason about the constraints (especially for debugging), but comes with a performance penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "![8-queens puzzle solution](EightQueens.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the 8-queens problem asks you to place 8 queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that none of the queens are in \"check\" (i.e., no two queens occupy the same row, column, or diagonal). The N-queens problem generalizes the puzzle to to any size square board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Lab Overview\n",
    "Students should read through the code and the wikipedia page (or other resources) to understand the N-queens problem, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Complete the warmup exercises in the [Sympy_Intro notebook](Sympy_Intro.ipynb) to become familiar with they sympy library and symbolic representation for constraints\n",
    "0. Implement the [NQueensCSP class](#II.-Representing-the-N-Queens-Problem) to develop an efficient encoding of the N-queens problem and explicitly generate the constraints bounding the solution\n",
    "0. Write the [search functions](#III.-Backtracking-Search) for recursive backtracking, and use them to solve the N-queens problem\n",
    "0. (Optional) Conduct [additional experiments](#IV.-Experiments-%28Optional%29) with CSPs and various modifications to the search order (minimum remaining values, least constraining value, etc.)"

    "## II. Representing the N-Queens Problem\n",
    "There are many acceptable ways to represent the N-queens problem, but one convenient way is to recognize that one of the constraints (either the row or column constraint) can be enforced implicitly by the encoding.  If we represent a solution as an array with N elements, then each position in the array can represent a column of the board, and the value at each position can represent which row the queen is placed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this encoding, we only need a constraint to make sure that no two queens occupy the same row, and one to make sure that no two queens occupy the same diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Symbolic Expressions for the Problem Constraints\n",
    "Before implementing the board class, we need to construct the symbolic constraints that will be used in the CSP.  Declare any symbolic terms required, and then declare two generic constraint generators:\n",
    "- `diffRow` - generate constraints that return True if the two arguments do not match\n",
    "- `diffDiag` - generate constraints that return True if two arguments are not on the same diagonal (Hint: you can easily test whether queens in two columns are on the same diagonal by testing if the difference in the number of rows and the number of columns match)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both generators should produce binary constraints (i.e., each should have two free symbols) once they're bound to specific variables in the CSP.  For example, Eq((a + b), (b + c)) is not a binary constraint, but Eq((a + b), (b + c)).subs(b, 1) _is_ a binary constraint because one of the terms has been bound to a constant, so there are only two free variables remaining.

Boards larger than 12x12 may take some time to solve because sympy is slow in the way its being used here, and because the selection and value ordering methods haven't been implemented.  See if you can implement any of the techniques in the AIMA text to speed up the solver!"

For example, represent the board as an array with $N^2$ elements, and let each element be True if there is a queen in that box, and False if it is empty.  Use an $N^2$-bit counter to generate solutions, then write a function to check if each solution is valid.  Notice that this solution doesn't require any of the techniques we've applied to other problems -- there is no DFS or backtracking, nor constraint propagation, or even explicitly defined variables.\n",
